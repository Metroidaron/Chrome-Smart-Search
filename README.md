### Production Goals/Desired feature list

>>>
##### Front End
- Base Web UI that displays when a search from the omnibar is entered.  This webpage should be slightly customizable (As in Color/background image) while the search is performed and display information as the search is initiated.
- Settings page where the user can access settings that will affect their search settings, but modifying these settings will have no effect on other users of the tool.  
- Server side settings where default values can be modified by any user OR by admin.  This should be set on the hosting server by the server admin.
- Import/Export Web UI where users can quickly copy/paste a JSON Formatted version of their rules for easy sharing.  This UI should allow the users to select some or all of their rules for sharing.

##### Back End
- Impliment a lightweight Node Server for easy local launching.
